When you live in the world of Harry Potter, death is around every corner, or, for readers, around every turn of the page. Life is unpredictable and often too short, but Harry Potter taught us that death itself isn't something to be afraid of, but instead "the next great adventure" â€” or so says Dumbledore.</p>
